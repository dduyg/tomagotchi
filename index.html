       <h2>Aesthetic Tears</h2>
       <p>The rain arrived softly that evening, falling like silk threads unraveling from a gray sky. Elara sat by the open window of her small apartment, sketchbook balanced on her knees, watching the world blur behind a veil of water. Her tea had long gone cold, untouched on the sill beside her, steam having vanished hours ago like every other fleeting warmth in her life.</p>
       <p>She was an artist, though she hadn’t painted in months. The canvases stacked in the corner were monuments of unfinished intentions — half-formed faces, blurred skies, dreamscapes abandoned mid-breath. The smell of turpentine clung to the air, mixing with the petrichor drifting in through the window. Everything about the space seemed caught between beauty and decay.</p>
       <p>Elara’s fingers traced the rim of her mug absently as she looked down at the street below. People hurried past under umbrellas, little bursts of color moving through grayness — crimson, cobalt, yellow — each one a fleeting stroke in the city’s living painting. She had once found poetry in such moments, once believed she could capture emotion with light and shadow. Now she felt only the dull ache of remembering what it was like to feel moved.</p>
       <p>On her desk, an envelope lay unopened. It was from the gallery she’d applied to months ago — the one she’d dreamed of exhibiting in since she was sixteen. The letter had arrived that morning, crisp and white against the chaos of her workspace. She’d stared at it for hours, unable to open it, as if the outcome might collapse her world either way.</p>
       <p>Her phone buzzed — a message from Lucien. <em>“Haven’t seen you in forever. Coffee tomorrow? Please.”</em></p>
       <p>Lucien had always been the light to her shadows. They had met in art school — he painted with laughter, bold colors, and sunlight. He had once told her that sadness could be beautiful, but only if it taught you something. Elara wasn’t sure hers had taught her anything except how heavy it felt to carry colorless days.</p>
       <p>She typed a reply: <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
       <p>The rain deepened, drumming against the windowpane in uneven rhythms. Elara rose, restless, and crossed the room to the mirror. Her reflection stared back — eyes tired, hair messy, a smear of graphite across her cheek. She smiled faintly. She looked like her art — imperfect, unfinished, yet strangely honest.</p>
       <p>She picked up a pencil and turned to a blank page. Her hand trembled at first, hesitant, then steadied. Lines formed: the curve of an eye, the shadow beneath it, the glint of light caught in a tear. It wasn’t planned — it never was — but the image emerged like a secret surfacing. The tear looked delicate, not of sorrow but of beauty, like something sacred.</p>
       <p>Hours passed unnoticed. When she finally set the pencil down, dawn was a pale whisper at the horizon. The city was waking, washed clean by the night’s rain. Elara looked at her drawing — a face both familiar and foreign, weeping tears that shimmered like glass. There was serenity in it, as though pain and peace had found a fragile truce.</p>
       <p>She realized, then, that she hadn’t cried in years. Not properly. Not the kind of tears that cleanse rather than corrode. She touched the paper gently, tracing the drawn tear with her fingertip, and something within her cracked open. The sob rose quietly, like a wave she’d forgotten how to swim through.</p>
       <p>She cried — not dramatically, not brokenly — but softly, like the rain had taught her. The tears fell warm and unhurried, each one a surrender. And as they fell, she saw how beautiful they were — small prisms of feeling catching the light that slipped through her window.</p>
       <p>When the last tear slid down her cheek, she felt lighter. Not healed, but breathing again.</p>
       <p>She reached for the envelope. Her fingers didn’t shake this time as she tore it open. The letter inside was brief:</p>
       <blockquote>
         <p><em>“Dear Ms. Vale,<br>
         We are pleased to inform you that your submission has been accepted for exhibition at the Albright Gallery. We found your work haunting, delicate, and deeply human. We look forward to seeing your next collection.”</em></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>For a long moment, she didn’t move. The words blurred — not because of sadness now, but because of something gentler, something reborn.</p>
       <p>Her next collection.</p>
       <p>She looked around her apartment — the unfinished canvases, the quiet mess, the pale light. She smiled through the tears still wet on her cheeks. For the first time in months, she felt the urge to paint. Not to impress, not to escape, but simply to <em>be</em>.</p>
       <p>She cleaned her brushes. She stretched a fresh canvas across the frame. Outside, the city began to glow under a new sun, droplets on the window glittering like tiny stars.</p>
       <p>Her first stroke was uncertain, then bolder. Blue melting into violet, then gold. She painted not what she saw, but what she had felt — the ache, the rain, the release. She painted her tears as light, her sadness as color.</p>
       <p>By the time Lucien knocked at her door that afternoon, the canvas was alive with motion — a storm giving birth to sunrise.</p>
       <p>He stepped inside, eyes wide. “Elara,” he breathed, “It’s… beautiful.”</p>
       <p>She smiled softly, a touch of dried salt at the corner of her eyes. “They’re aesthetic tears,” she said. “The kind that don’t hurt anymore.”</p>
       <p>Outside, the sky was clear. Inside, the colors began again.</p>
