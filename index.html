        <section id="contentSection">
            <p>A tachyon (from the Greek: œÑŒ±œáœçœÇ (tach√∫s), 'fast') is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of light. In theoretical physics, tachyons have been proposed, but there is currently no experimental evidence for their existence. According to special relativity, objects with mass cannot reach or exceed the speed of light, but tachyons, if they exist, would violate this principle. They are primarily discussed in the context of theoretical physics and speculative theories.</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Tachyon04s.gif" alt="‚éÑ" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            <p>Because a tachyon moves faster than light, we would not be able to see it approaching. After it has passed us, we would see two images of it: one in the direction it is flying (left) and the other in the direction from which it came (right). Both images would move away from us. The image of the receding particle (left) would exhibit a redshift due to the Doppler effect, while the image of the approaching particle would show a blueshift. The black line is a snapshot of the shockwave of Cherenkov radiation.</p>

                content: `
                    <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method used to simplify and summarize the variation in a dataset. It transforms the original data into a new coordinate system, where the axes represent the principal components (PCs) of variation in the data.</p>
                    <h3>How <code>PCA</code> Works:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Data Centering:</strong> PCA begins by centering the data by subtracting the mean from each feature. This ensures that the data is centered around the origin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Covariance Matrix:</strong> PCA then calculates the covariance matrix of the centered data. The covariance matrix describes the relationships between the different features in the dataset.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eigenvalue Decomposition:</strong> Next, PCA performs eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix to find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, while eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of variance along those directions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Selecting Principal Components:</strong> PCA sorts the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. The eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues are chosen as the principal components. These principal components capture the most significant sources of variation in the data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Finally, PCA projects the original data onto the subspace spanned by the selected principal components. This reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much variance as possible. The number of principal components retained is typically chosen based on the amount of variance explained or a predetermined threshold.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Overall, PCA is a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the underlying structure of complex datasets.</p>

                content: `
                    <p>Data-Centric AI is an approach to artificial intelligence development that focuses on systematically improving the quality and characteristics of data rather than primarily iterating on model architecture or algorithms.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Improving data quality</strong> ‚Äì Fixing labeling errors, standardizing annotations, ensuring consistency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data engineering</strong> ‚Äì Carefully curating, cleaning, and organizing training data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Systematic data iteration</strong> ‚Äì Treating data improvement as an engineering discipline rather than a one-time collection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Contrast with Model-Centric AI</h3>
                    <p>Traditionally, AI development was <strong>model-centric</strong>: keeping datasets fixed while experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training techniques.</p>
                    <p>Data-centric AI flips this: it advocates keeping the model fixed (or using standard architectures) while systematically improving the data itself.</p>
                    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>In production environments, especially with smaller datasets or specialized domains, data quality often matters more than model sophistication. Common data issues such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inconsistent labeling between annotators</li>
                        <li>Missing edge cases</li>
                        <li>Class imbalances</li>
                        <li>Noisy or incorrect labels</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>...can limit model performance far more than the choice of architecture or hyperparameters.</p>
                    <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
                    <p>Data-centric approaches include a variety of techniques and tools designed to continuously improve dataset quality and coverage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active learning to identify which data points to label</li>
                        <li>Better annotation tools and processes</li>
                        <li>Data augmentation strategies</li>
                        <li>Techniques to detect and fix label errors</li>
                        <li>Methods to ensure training data represents real-world distribution</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This mindset has become increasingly important as foundation models make sophisticated architectures readily available, shifting the competitive advantage to those with better, more carefully curated data.</p>

                title: 'Tachyon',
                content: `
                    <p>A tachyon (from the Greek: œÑŒ±œáœçœÇ (tach√∫s), 'fast') is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of light. In theoretical physics, tachyons have been proposed, but there is currently no experimental evidence for their existence. According to special relativity, objects with mass cannot reach or exceed the speed of light, but tachyons, if they exist, would violate this principle. They are primarily discussed in the context of theoretical physics and speculative theories.</p>
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Tachyon04s.gif" alt="‚éÑ" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
                    <p>Because a tachyon moves faster than light, we would not be able to see it approaching. After it has passed us, we would see two images of it: one in the direction it is flying (left) and the other in the direction from which it came (right). Both images would move away from us. The image of the receding particle (left) would exhibit a redshift due to the Doppler effect, while the image of the approaching particle would show a blueshift. The black line is a snapshot of the shockwave of Cherenkov radiation.</p>
