      <h2>Python naming conventions</h2>
          <p>Python follows the PEP 8 style guide for naming conventions. Here are some key points:</p>
          <h3>Variables and Functions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use lowercase letters for variable names.</li>
            <li>Separate words with underscores to improve readability.</li>
            <li>Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.</li>
            <li>Functions should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.</li>
            <li>Avoid using single character names except for loop counters or temporary variables.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Constants</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use uppercase letters for constants.</li>
            <li>Separate words with underscores.</li>
            <li>Constants should represent fixed values that do not change during the execution of the program.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use PascalCase for class names.</li>
            <li>Class names should be nouns and start with a capital letter.</li>
            <li>Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the class.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Modules and Packages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use lowercase names for modules and packages.</li>
            <li>Separate words with underscores if needed.</li>
            <li>Module names should be short and descriptive.</li>
            <li>Avoid using names that conflict with standard Python modules or built-in functions.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>R naming conventions</h2>
          <p>R programming language follows its own set of naming conventions. Here are the key points:</p>
          <h3>Variables and Functions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use lowercase letters for variable names.</li>
            <li>Separate words with underscores or use camelCase.</li>
            <li>Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.</li>
            <li>Functions should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.</li>
            <li>Avoid using reserved words as variable names.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Constants</h3>
          <ul><li>Constants are not explicitly defined in R, but conventionally use uppercase letters for variables that are not intended to be modified.</li></ul>
          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>R uses S3 and S4 class systems for object-oriented programming.</li>
            <li>Class names should be meaningful and follow the same conventions as variable names.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Packages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Package names should be descriptive and lowercase.</li>
            <li>Avoid using names that conflict with existing R packages.</li>
          </ul>
