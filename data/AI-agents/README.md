# About Dataset
### AI Agents Dataset — GitHub Repositories, Use Cases

Curated list of AI agent use-cases with direct links to GitHub implementations.

## Overview
A compact, curated CSV of AI agent projects with a short title, industry tag, one-line description, and a direct GitHub link. The dataset is intended as a discovery and enrichment seed for engineers, researchers, and educators looking for real-world agent code examples.

## How It Was Collected
Entries were gathered from publicly available GitHub repositories and project examples. Links may point to full repos, notebooks, or subfolders and were captured as-is.

## Suggested Uses
This dataset is mostly useful for RAG based systems to automate AI Agent building or coding.

## Minimal Notes & Limitations
- Link Stability: Links were valid at curation time but can change — verify before automated use.
- License Heterogeneity: Each linked repo has its own license; respect those licenses when using code.
- Not a Complete Corpus: This is a metadata seed (short descriptions + links). For training or indexing, fetch full README and source files to enrich the dataset.

## About this file
The main data file, typically a CSV, contains 71 records of different AI agent projects. Each row includes four columns:
1. Use Case: The project's main function or title.
2. Industry: The sector the agent is designed for (e.g., Finance, Education, Software Development).
3. Description: A brief, one-line summary of what the agent does.
4. Code GitHub: A direct URL link to the open-source implementation on GitHub.

This file acts as a foundational index for discovering real-world AI agent code, enabling quick access for research, development, and educational purposes.
