## How to get an OpenAI API key for your Streamlit app

✅ 1. Create (or log into) your OpenAI account

Go to: https://platform.openai.com and log in.

✅ 2. Go to "API Keys"

Visit: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys

You will see a page like:

> “Create new secret key”

✅ 3. Click Create new secret key

Choose a name (example: streamlit_app).

Click Create.

You will get something like:

sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Copy it.
You will not see it again, so store it somewhere safe.


✅ 4. Add the key to your Streamlit app

If you deploy on Streamlit Cloud:

Create a file in your repo:

.streamlit/secrets.toml

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxx"

Then in your app code:

client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

That's it.

⚠️ IMPORTANT

Do NOT commit the secret key into GitHub code.
Always store it in: Streamlit Cloud → Secrets

.streamlit/secrets.toml (not tracked by Git)
