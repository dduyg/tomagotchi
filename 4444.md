## 🧹 Clean One-Liners with List Comprehensions & Conditionals

Replace clunky for-loops with elegant list comprehensions.

```python
# Filter and lowercase only valid strings
cleaned = [s.lower() for s in raw_strings if isinstance(s, str)]
```

🔥 *Tip:* Combine `.strip()` or `.replace()` inline for power combos.

---

## 🪄 Use `functools.lru_cache` for Fast Lookups

Avoid redundant expensive computations with automatic memoization.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=256)
def get_user_features(user_id):
    return fetch_from_slow_api(user_id)
```

💡 *Great for:* Feature engineering, lookup-heavy transformations.

---

## 🧊 Dataclasses for Lightweight Data Models

Need structured data classes without the boilerplate?

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Record:
    id: int
    status: str
    created_at: str
```

🧩 *Alternative:* Use `pydantic` if validation is also needed.

---

## 🧼 Safe Parsing with `try/except` One-Liners

Handle dirty data without interrupting flows.

```python
def to_int(val):
    try:
        return int(val)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return None
```

🛡️ *Pattern:* Wrap noisy transforms to preserve pipeline stability.

---

## 🧪 Quick Profiling with `cProfile`

Find bottlenecks without external tools.

```bash
python -m cProfile your_script.py
```

🕵️ *Use when:* Your data pipeline feels slow but you're unsure where.

---

## 💫 Bonus Tips

- Use `itertools.groupby` for efficient streaming aggregation.
- Use `defaultdict(list)` to simplify nested groupings.
- Use `.join()` + f-strings to build cleaner logs.
